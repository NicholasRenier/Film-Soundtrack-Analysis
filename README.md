# Music Curation and Analytics 2018
Nicholas Renier - Film Soundtrack Analysis Project

Welcome to my GitHub Repository! Here you will find all the html, css and javascript files that make up the website that showcases my project. On the website, you can explore Veriovio renderings of mei files, technical metadata, analysis from Sonic Visualiser, Music21 and jSymbolic among much more. Alternatively, you can download the zipped folders that will allow you to explore MuseScore files, audio files, raw data and a vast array of other associated files.

Thank you!
