  			<div id="box">
  				<h3>Theme: Film Soundtracks (focussing on scores written specifically for films)</h3>
  				<br>
  				<p>I chose Film Soundtracks/Scores as the theme for this project as films are
  				one of my greatest passions and interests in life. I absolutely love film music
  				and admire how it is such a huge and significant component of the filmmaking process.
  				Good music can undoubtedly lift the quality of a film and go a long way to help
  				establish the tone or mood of a particular scene or cinematic sequence. I particularly
  				enjoy how music can exist in a diegetic or non-diegetic way in cinema: either as part
  				of the world created by the film (e.g. music playing on a radio that the characters
  				can hear) or outside of the filmic world (orchestral score given only to the viewer).
 				<br><br>
				The pieces I have chosen to focus on are six of my favourite examples of the film
				soundtrack genre: three written for marimba/xylophone and three written for piano.
				They were all originally written for their respective movies, with the exception of
				the first two, ‘You’re So Cool’ and ‘Gassenhauer’, which are variations of the same
				song (this will be explained in greater detail further down this page). All pieces
				also fall into the non-diegetic category, with the exception of ‘Cantina Band’ in
				Star Wars, which of course is played on-screen by the titular Cantina Band.</p>

				<h3>Data Types</h3>
				<br>
				<p>The three main types of musical data explored in this project were:
					<ol>
						<li>Descriptive Data</li>
						<li>Notated Data</li>
						<li>Acoustic Data</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h3>Descriptive Data</h3>
				<br>
				<p>There are many online databases dedicated exclusively to film soundtracks and
				a couple of the most popular examples are detailed below. Additionally, the IMDb
				(Internet Movie Database) is a good place to find a wide variety of metadata relating
				to film soundtracks.
				<br><br>
				<b>Soundtrack Collector</b>
				(<a href="http://www.soundtrackcollector.com" target="_blank">soundtrackcollector.com</a>)
					<ul>
						<li>Online soundtrack database of substantial size. The site claims to host
						over 53,000 movie titles, 74,000 labels, 11,000 composers, 21,000 movie posters,
						49,000 cover images, 37,000 track listings and 11,000 links to reviews.</li>
						<li>Allows users to explore the site by movie titles (A-Z), composers (A-Z)
						or search the entire database by movie title, soundtrack, composer, label number
						or track.</li>
						<li>When exploring by composer, the list is arranged in alphabetical order of surname
						(e.g. Hans Zimmer is under ‘Z’). When a composer is selected from the list, the user
						is presented with the following information: full name, an image of the person, birth
						date, country of origin, a link to their website and a reasonably-sized biography
						detailing some key films and dates of the composer’s career. Beneath this is a link to
						view the filmo/discography of this specific composer.</li>
						<li>When viewing the discography of a specific composer, the list is presented in a
						chronological order, beginning with the composer’s earliest work. Six types of
						metadata are displayed:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Year</li>
								<li>Movie Title</li>
								<li>Label</li>
								<li>Country</li>
								<li>Star Rating (out of five)</li>
								<li>Format (e.g. CD, DVD, LP etc)</li>
							</ul>
						<li>The user can view certain time periods by selecting options from the “Go to years”
						dropdown menu (e.g. 1996-2000).</li>
						<li>Once the user has selected a movie title, they are given information about the
						film including its year of release, country and genre. The user can then view all
						of the existing productions of the film soundtrack including features in compilation albums.</li>
						<li>Unfortunately, although the Soundtrack Collector database is well-organised and
						well-populated, there are no tools available to the user to analyse the data to any extent.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				<b>Soundtrack.net</b>
				(<a href="https://www.soundtrack.net" target="_blank">soundtrack.net</a>)
					<ul>
						<li>Similar purpose and structure to that of the Soundtrack Collector database.</li>
						<li>The home page features a news section, new soundtrack releases, upcoming
						soundtrack releases, movies currently in cinemas and more.</li>
						<li>The user can browse the database by movie release date, title, composer
						or soundtrack (title, composer or manufacturer) and can also view news & reviews
						and trailer music.</li>
						<li>In terms of the way in which this site presents its data, there is a stand-out
						problem to note: when viewing the list of movies & tv shows, the list is sorted
						alphabetically. However, any title that begins with “The” is sorted under ‘T’.
						This is problematic because of the high volume of titles which fit this category,
						making it harder for the user to find their desired title. Most film databases
						avoid this issue by disregarding the “The” and instead sorting by the word that
						follows straight after. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Soundtrack.net.</li>
					</ul>
  				</p>
  				<br><br>
  				<h3>Notated Data</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Sheet music for film scores and soundtracks can be found in both free and paid
						versions in online repositories. Some of the best sources include Musescore.com,
						Musicnotes.com and Noviscore.com. These scores generally take the form of downloadable
						pdf files. However, in the case of MuseScore, a signed-in user can download the file in
						many different formats: a MuseScore file (playable in the MuseScore desktop program),
						pdf, MusicXML, MIDI and also mp3. In my experience, MuseScore also has the best
						collection of online scores and the data on the website is well-structured and organised
						for easy search and retrieval.</li>
						<li>Another popular source of notated data is printed sheet music. Traditional
						bricks-and-mortar music shops will stock soundtrack sheet music, but a far greater
						selection will always be found in online stores such as Musicroom.com and Thomann.de
						and the usual e-commerce giants like Amazon and Ebay.</li>
						<li>Notated data for film scores and soundtracks can also take the form of guitar
						tablature: an alternative to traditional common Western music notation. Again, these
						can be found in printed books, but the best sources are online: notably Ultimate-guitar.com,
						Guitartabs.cc and Hooktheory.com.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h3>Acoustic Data</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Official original soundtrack albums are generally released in conjunction with,
						or closely following, the cinematic release of their filmic companions. Different
						physical formats have been used over the years including vinyl, cassette tapes and
						CDs but the focus has now shifted to online music streaming platforms and digital
						downloads. The compressed mp3 audio file is the most common format in these modern
						cases, however there are high-fidelity streaming services such as Tidal that offer
						uncompressed audio with higher bit rates in the form of FLAC and ALAC files.</li>
						<li>In the cases of streaming services including Apple Music and Spotify, there are
						entire sections dedicated to film and tv soundtracks and users can also find curated
						playlists relating to screen music.</li>
						<li>Another source of acoustic data is live concert performances of film music. These
						have also been recorded and captured on video. DVDs and Blu-ray discs are a common way
						of accessing these performances, although digital versions are again available to buy
						online or stream on platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.</li>
						<li>Finally, YouTube is always a reliable option for finding recordings of film
						soundtracks. There are user-created playlists and videos from official movie studio
						channels and with the sheer volume of content available on the online platform, users
						should always be able to locate what they are looking for.</li>
					</ul>

  				<h3>'You're So Cool' and 'Gassenhauer'</h3>
  				<br>
  				<p>'Gassenhauer', or 'Gassenhauer nach Hans Neusiedler' (1536), is a short piece from Carl Orff’s
  				Schulwerk (a music education method developed by Carl Orff and Gunild Keetman in the 1920s).
  				As the full title indicates, it is either an arrangement of, or inspired by, a much older work
  				by the lutenist Hans Neusiedler from 1536. The piece is credited to Orff's long-time
  				collaborator, Gunild Keetman, on at least one recent release of the Schulwerk. Numerous
  				different interpretations of this song have been used in various films and television
  				programmes. For example, a very true-to-original version of the piece was used in the
  				soundtrack of the film <i>Badlands</i> (1973). Later, Hans Zimmer wrote a re-worked version of the
  				piece for the soundtrack of the film <i>True Romance</i> (1993).</p>
